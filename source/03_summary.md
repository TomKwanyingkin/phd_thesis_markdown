# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

Currently, not only does the widely spreading Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) kills nearly 2.7 millions of people, but it also inconveniences and bothers the public so much. For instance, in order to prevent infection, people need to find a key or prepare tissues to press the elevator button without touching it with bare hand. In light of this, the project aims to facilitate the process of taking an elevator. A natural user interface will be designed to replace the traditional buttons panel. Users just need to make hand gestures that represent the floor number without pressing any buttons in front of the camera. Then, the system will automatically recognize the gestures and command the elevator to bring the users to the corresponding floor. 

In this project, the hand recognition system applying the AI technologies would be adopted as natural user interface. The implemented AI technologies includes the deep learning neural networks and the transfer learning of MediaPipe.

The accuracy can reach around 90% when recognizing the hand gestures of a single user and 80% while recognizing the hand gestures of multiple users.
